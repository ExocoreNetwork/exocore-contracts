# Ethereum Native Restaking for Exocore

## Overview

Native restaking is distinguished from LSD restaking with unique features: No LSD token is involved for native stakers to participate in the Exocore restaking.
Instead, all the restaker of Ethereum needs to do is:

1. create an ExoCapsule contract owned by the restaker itself through the Exocore gateway contract.
2. deposit 32 ETH to Ethereum beacon chain to become an activated validator, and point the withdrawal-credential(withdrawal address) to the ExoCapsule address created in the last step. Or deposit to activate multiple beacon chain validators and point the withdrawal-credentials of all validators to the ExoCapsule address created in the last step. So one restaker could activate multiple beacon chain validators.
3. For each of the beacon chain validator that the restaker owns, after the validator on beacon chain is activated and before the validator's balance is fully withdrawn from beacon chain, restaker could deposit `stakedETH` of this validator into Exocore by verifying  `ValidatorContainer`, which is included in the beacon chain block, with `ValidatorContainerProof`, that is generated by querying beacon chain node, against the beacon block root fetched from `BeaconRoot` contract(proposed by EIP4788 and enabled in the latest Dencun upgrade). Upon deposit, the exchange rate between `stakedETH` and Ethereum `ETH` is 1:1, and the restaker's total balance of `stakedETH` in Exocore is the summary of the effective balance of all validators that restaker owns before restaker delegates to any operator.
4. For each of the beacon chain validator that the restaker owns, after the validator on beacon chain is activated and before the validator's balance is fully withdrawn from beacon chain, the validator's effective balance may change owing to rewards, penalties and even slashing. But this should not affect the restaker's balance in Exocore, instead validator's balance changes on beacon chain only result in the change of exchange rate between restaker's `stakedETH` and Ethereum `ETH`. That is the restaker's balance of `stakedETH` could only be changed via delegation in Exocore, but the value of each `stakedETH` coin could vary owing to the rewards/penalties/slashing on beacon chain.
5. For each of the beacon chain validator that the restaker owns, after the validator on beacon chain is activated and before the validator's balance is fully withdrawn from beacon chain, validator's effective balance is capped at 32 ETH, and the exceeding part would be automatically sent to the withdrawal address, which is the restaker's ExoCapsule address. This is called partial withdrawal, and restaker could claim this part from owned ExoCapsule to restaker's address by verifying the `WithdrawalContainer`, which is included as `ExecutionPayload` in beacon block, with `WithdrawalProof` generated by querying node, against the beacon block root fetched from `BeaconRoot` contract(proposed by EIP4788 and enabled in the latest Dencun upgrade).
6. For each of the beacon chain validator that the restaker owns, after the validator's balance is fully withdrawn, restaker could withdraw `stakedETH` to get Ethereum `ETH` from ExoCapsule by:
   1. verifying the latest `ValidateContainer` has `withdrawableEpoch` set(empty value is type(uint64).max) and current block timestamp exceeds the `withdrawableEpoch`.
   2. verifying the `WithdrawalContainer`, which is included as `ExecutionPayload` in beacon block, with `WithdrawalProof` generated by querying node, against the beacon block root fetched from `BeaconRoot` contract(proposed by EIP4788 and enabled in the latest Dencun upgrade).

## Ethereum Beacon Chain Proof

### Data Structures

`BeaconBlock` container is the most high level data structure involved in verifying the inclusion proof of specific beacon state data, so ordinally we verify expected data fields against the beacon block root hash. After Dencun upgrade(already activated on Ethereum mainnet), EIP4788 is activated and a beacon root contract is deployed to allow smart contracts fetching beacon block root at specific timestamp.

```
class BeaconBlock(Container):
    slot: Slot
    proposer_index: ValidatorIndex
    parent_root: Root
    state_root: Root
    body: BeaconBlockBody
```

`BeaconBlockHeader` container is the `BeaconBlock` Lite, with same fields except `BeaconBlockBody` is included as `BodyRoot` instead of actual `BeaconBlockBody` container.

```
class BeaconBlockHeader(Container):
    slot: Slot
    proposer_index: ValidatorIndex
    parent_root: Root
    state_root: Root
    body_root: Root
```

`BeaconBlockBody` container contains the block data `execution_payload` that should be applied to generate new `BeaconState`.

```
class BeaconBlockBody(Container):
    randao_reveal: BLSSignature
    eth1_data: Eth1Data  # Eth1 data vote
    graffiti: Bytes32  # Arbitrary data
    # Operations
    proposer_slashings: List[ProposerSlashing, MAX_PROPOSER_SLASHINGS]
    attester_slashings: List[AttesterSlashing, MAX_ATTESTER_SLASHINGS]
    attestations: List[Attestation, MAX_ATTESTATIONS]
    deposits: List[Deposit, MAX_DEPOSITS]
    voluntary_exits: List[SignedVoluntaryExit, MAX_VOLUNTARY_EXITS]
    sync_aggregate: SyncAggregate

    # Capella operations
    bls_to_execution_changes: List[SignedBLSToExecutionChange, MAX_BLS_TO_EXECUTION_CHANGES]  # [New in Capella]
```

`ExecutionPayload` container is included in `BeaconBlockBody` and it contains block transactions as well as beacon chain withdrawals.

```
class ExecutionPayload(Container):
    # Execution block header fields
    parent_hash: Hash32
    fee_recipient: ExecutionAddress  # 'beneficiary' in the yellow paper
    state_root: Bytes32
    receipts_root: Bytes32
    logs_bloom: ByteVector[BYTES_PER_LOGS_BLOOM]
    prev_randao: Bytes32  # 'difficulty' in the yellow paper
    block_number: uint64  # 'number' in the yellow paper
    gas_limit: uint64
    gas_used: uint64
    timestamp: uint64
    extra_data: ByteList[MAX_EXTRA_DATA_BYTES]
    base_fee_per_gas: uint256
    # Extra payload fields
    block_hash: Hash32  # Hash of execution block
    transactions: List[Transaction, MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD]
    withdrawals: List[Withdrawal, MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_PAYLOAD]  # [New in Capella]
```

`Withdrawal` container is included in `ExecutionPayload` container and it includes validator's withdrawal information like `validator_index` that indicates specific validator's index in the `BeaconState`'s `validators` list. `Withdrawal` container is used for verifying partial or fully withdrawal of specific validator in native restaking scenary.

```
class Withdrawal(Container):
    index: WithdrawalIndex
    validator_index: ValidatorIndex
    address: ExecutionAddress
    amount: Gwei
```

`BeaconState` container is included as `stete_root` inside `BeaconBlock` and it includes all the beacon chain state variables, especially all registered validators for `validators`.

```
class BeaconState(Container):
    class BeaconState(Container):
    # Versioning
    genesis_time: uint64
    genesis_validators_root: Root
    slot: Slot
    fork: Fork

    # Deep history valid from Capella onwards
    historical_summaries: List[HistoricalSummary, HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT]  # [New in Capella]
```

`Validator` container is included in `BeaconState` as a list, and it includes validator's properties like `pubkey`, `withdrawal_credentials`, `effective_balance`, `withdrawal_epoch` and so on. `Validator` container is used in various scenarios like `ExoCapsule.deposit`, `ExoCapsule.updateStakeBalance` and `ExoCapsule.withdraw` to verify validator's information and update validator's staking balance.

```
class Validator(Container):
    pubkey: BLSPubkey
    withdrawal_credentials: Bytes32  # Commitment to pubkey for withdrawals
    effective_balance: Gwei  # Balance at stake
    slashed: boolean
    # Status epochs
    activation_eligibility_epoch: Epoch  # When criteria for activation were met
    activation_epoch: Epoch
    exit_epoch: Epoch
    withdrawable_epoch: Epoch  # When validator can withdraw funds
```

### Beacon Block Data Merklelization

Beacon block root is the merkle root hash of the `BeaconBlock`. The merklelization of `BeaconBlock` is done recursively from the most underlying data fields to containers until the most high level `BeaconBlock`. The whole serialization and merklelization process follow the [`SSZ` rules](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/ssz/simple-serialize.md).

Most important rules related to native restaking merkle proof are:

1. `merkleize(pack(value))` if value is a basic object or a vector of basic objects.
2. `merkleize([hash_tree_root(element) for element in value])` if value is a vector of composite objects or a container.
3. `mix_in_length(merkleize([hash_tree_root(element) for element in value], limit=chunk_count(type)), len(value))` if value is a list of composite objects, where `mix_in_length` means: Given a Merkle root `root` and a length `length` ("uint256" little-endian serialization) return `hash(root + length)`.

Take `Validator` container as example: `Validator` container is merklelized by:

1. serializing container fields into chunks of `bytes32` and using them as merkle tree leafs.
2. dividing leafs into pairs in order, the missing leafs would be replaces by zero `bytes32`.
3. hashing all the pairs to get new leafs, and recursively doing this until there exists only one hash, which is the root hash of `Validator` container.

Given `BeaconState` include a list of `Validator` containers as `validators` field, so `Validator` containers roots are first merklelized to get a root hash, and then this root hash with the `validators` length together is hashed to get the real root hash of `validators` field.

## `stakedETH` For Ethereum Native Restaking

When a restaker verifies an owned and activated beacon chain validator, the restaker could deposit the validator's effective balance into Exocore. The deposit actually mints dedicated `stakedETH` token for the restaker. Note:

1. This `stakedETH` is only used for tracking the summary of restaker owned validators' effective balances, so it is not an actual token that anyone could transfer like normal ERC20 tokens. It could only be minted by Exocore's native `Deposit` module when the restaker deposits into Exocore via native restaking interfaces, and only be burnt by other relative native modules when restaker gets penalized/slashed or withdraws from Exocore.
2. The `stakedETH` token is created per restaker, which means supposing when Alice and Bob deposit into Exocore via native restaking interfaces, a dedicated `AliceStakedETH` token and `BobStakedETH` token would be created for Alice and Bob. So the exchange rate change of `AliceStakedETH` would not influce the exchange rate of `BobStakedETH`.
3. When the `stakedETH` per restaker is created, it is created with initial exchange rate of 1:1 against Ethereum `ETH`. That is to say: given Alice firstly deposits `100` staked `ETH` into Exocore via native restaking interfaces, a dedicated `stakedETH` token is created for Alice's address with 1:1 exchange rate against `ETH`, and `100` `stakedETH` tokens are minted for Alice. After initial deposit, further deposit would mint `stakedETH` according to deposited ETH balance and the exchange rate between them.
4. restaker's `stakeETH` balance(token amount) could ony increase via native restaking deposit, and decrease by being penalized/slashed when the restaker delegates to specific operator or by being withdrawan by restaker.

### Exchange Rate of `stakedETH`

The total value of specific `stakedETH` against `ETH` is evaluated with its total supply and its exchange rate:

```solidity
uint256 totalValue(stakedETH) = supplyOf(stakedETH) * exchangeRate(stakedETH)
```

This exchange rate is also the price of `stakedETH` against `ETH`.

Upon token being created, the price of `stakedETH` is initialized as 1 `ETH`. After the token being created(the first deposit of restaker), the price of `stakedETH` would only change when at least one of the restaker's beacon chain validator's effective balance changes because of beacon chain rewards/penalties/slashing.

After deposit, when the effective balance of one of restaker's validators increases `delta` `ETH` owing to beacon chain rewards, the latest price of `stakedETH` would be updated according to this logic:

```solidity
latestPrice = (supplyOf(stakedETH) * latestPrice + delta) / supplyOf(stakedETH) 
```

The same logics apply for situations where restaker's validators effective balance decreases owing to penalties/slashing, except we should check underflow more carefully.

Now we would give an example of how restaker's beacon chain balance changes and restaker's `stakedETH` balance changes influence the price of `stakedETH`:

1. At first Alice deposit `20` staked `ETH` into Exocore via native restaking interfaces, and after deposit Alice has `20` `stakedETH` and the price of `stakedETH` is 1 `ETH`.

2. Secondly, because of Alice proposes an Ethereum beacon chain block, she receives `10` `ETH` as rewards and one of her deposited validator's effective balance increases `10` `ETH`. Now we should update the price of `stakedETH` like this:

```solidity
latestPrice = (20 * 1 + 10) / 20 /// result is 1.5 
```

That is to say after update the price of `stakedETH` has come to `1.5` `ETH`. And Now Alice has `20` `stakedETH` with value of `30` `ETH`.

3. Thirdly, Alice delegates all `20` `stakedETH` to an operator, but unfortunately `10` `stakedETH` was penalized and burnt for operator misbehaviour. Now the supply of `stakedETH` is `10`, and Alice has `10` `stakedETH` with value of `15` `ETH`, but the price of `stakedETH` does not change.

4. At last, Alice gets penalized on beacon chain and one of her deposited validator's effective balance suffer a `10` `ETH` decrease. Now we should update the price of `stakedETH` like this:

```solidity
latestPrice = (10 * 1.5 - 10) / 10 /// result is 0.5 
```

That is to say: after update the price of `stakedETH` has decreased to `0.5` `ETH` and now Alice has `10` `stakedETH` with value of `5` `ETH`.

## Main Design Differences Compared With EigenLayer

1. For EigenLayer EigenPod, you could deposit beacon chain validator even if it is exited or withdrawan, which means not activated. But for ExoCapsule, the validator is restricted to be deposited only when it is activated.
2. For EigenLayer EigenPod, if restaker's deposited valdiator's effective balance changes owing to rewards/penalties/slashing, restaker's shares would be increased/decreased correspondingly if restaker has delegated. But Exocore would mint specialized LST(`stakedETH`) per restaker and the balance of this LST is not changed for beacon chain rewards/penalties/slash, instead the price of LST changes.
