### Bootstrap
The Bootstrap smart contract is designed to manage token whitelisting, operator registration, deposits, and withdrawals. It ensures that operations are locked during specific periods (before mainnet/testnet launch) for security. This contract is independent and upgrades itself to ClientChainGateway after the mainnet/testnet launch.

### ExocoreGateway

This contract provides functionalities such as deposits, delegations, undelegations, and the withdrawal of principal and rewards. It facilitates cross-chain communication through the LayerZero protocol.

### ClientChainGateway
The ClientChainGateway contract acts as a cross-chain gateway, transmitting information and commands between the Exocore core layer and the client chain. It verifies and executes signed commands such as deposits, withdrawals, and delegation, manages whitelisted assets and their Vault deployments, allows stakers to interact with the core layer through events, and provides emergency pause and resume functions to ensure system stability.

### BaseRestakingController
The BaseRestakingController contract is an abstract contract. It primarily handles the fundamental logic related to restaking, including declarations, delegations, undelegations, and messaging with the Exocore chain.

### LSTRestakingController
The LSTRestakingController contract  an abstract contract, which provides functionalities for users to deposit tokens, withdraw principal from Exocore, and withdraw rewards from Exocore. It primarily handles operations related to Liquid Staking Tokens (LST).

### NativeRestakingController

### Vault
The Vault smart contract manages deposits, withdrawals, and balance updates for users interacting with the system. It ensures secure handling of ERC20 tokens and implements business logic to maintain accurate records of user balances, including principal and reward amounts.

### ExoCapsule
